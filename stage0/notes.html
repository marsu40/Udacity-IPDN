    	<div>
	    	<b>The world wide web</b>	 
	        It was developed in the early 1990's. It is a collection of html documents. 
	        html stands for HyperText Markup Language which   is the basis for almost any webpage.
	      You can find several types of documents on the web (images, videos, music,...).
	      HTML allows to organize all those things together.
	      The hyperlinks allow to link the pages to one another.

    	<div>
      		Their are 3 major components of the web :
       		<ul>
           		<li>A PC running a web browser (ex. Firefox, Chrome)</li>
          		<li>The internet</li>
          		<li>Servers (computers like a normal PC but dedicated for hosting files)</li>
      		</ul>
      		the PC running the browser, to be able to communicate with the server uses a simple protocol called <em>HTTP</em>.

    		<b> HTML </b>
    		<div>
    			An HTML page is composed of:
        		<ul>
        			<li>Text content</li>
        			<li>Markup (tags allowing to modify the way the text or other elemnts appears)</li>
        			<li>References ot other documents (images, videos, sounds, ..)</li>
        			<li>Links to other pages (hyperlinks)</li> 
        		</ul>
    		</div>
    		<div>
    			<b>HTML Elements</b>
    			<p>HTML Elements correspond to the markup par of HTML.<br> 
    			They allow to tell the web browser how to display the page.<br>
    			They most of the time consist in an opening tag and a closing tag (ex. &ltb&gt content &ltb&gt).<br>
    			When there is no closing tags, the tag is called void tag (ex. &ltimg&gt).
    			</p>
    		</div>
    	</div>
    	<div>
    		<b>HTML Attributes</b>
    		<p>Some elements can include values which are called attributes.<br> 
    		They provide additional information to the browser.<br> 
    		For example: &ltimg src="url" alt="text"&gt Displays the image hosted at the src attribute value "url".<br> 
    		If the image cannot be displayed, then the alt attribute value "text" is shown.
    		We have also to differenciate "inline" from "block" elements.<br>
    		Inline elements do not have any specific behavior on the content they encompas between their opening and closing tags.<br>
    		On the other hand, block elements, create a virtual "box" around the content between their opening and closing tags.
    		</p>
